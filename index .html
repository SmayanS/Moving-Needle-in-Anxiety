        <p style="font-size: 25px;">
            For a lot of people talking to someone with a mental health condition such as anxiety might be intimidating due to all the stigma surrounding all of mental health. However, it is important to understand that these people are still people, even though they have something else going on. When you are talking to one of these individuals it’s important to take some time to hear them out and let them share as much as they want. You don’t want to try to diagnose them since they are already talking to a professional or still trying to understand what they are feeling and you might get in the way. You want to create a safe environment and express your continued support so they feel that this is a trusted space where they can share again. It is important to treat them as if they are anyone else, since they are already feeling left out and you don’t want to add on to that further. However if the situation turns dire and they talk of harming themselves or other it important to contact authorities since safety is the first priority.
